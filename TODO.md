# TODO — the ONE list (central index)

**This file is the single source of truth for "what's open and where the detail lives."**
There are ~75 scattered TODO/HANDOFF/STATUS/PLAN docs across the repos (a session
left one each). Don't read them all — each ACTIVE item below links to its single
authoritative detail doc. Dated `HANDOFF_*` / `NEXT_SESSION_*` / `*_2026-*` files
are HISTORICAL SNAPSHOTS — ignore unless archaeology is needed.

Convention: update the **Active** section here each session (one line per item +
link). Keep the depth in the linked doc, not here. Last updated: 2026-06-11.

## 🔴 ACTIVE / OPEN

| # | Workstream | State | Authoritative doc |
|---|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | **LTX2 inference → trainer** (video+audio, production quality) | PAUSED (GPU handed back). Inference recipe/conditioning gap reproduces in the OFFICIAL pipeline; resume plan staged. | `serenitymojo/docs/LTX2_TODO.md` |
| 2 | **Phase-5 process-isolation-per-model** (daemon) | CPU scaffold DONE + CPU e2e PASS (spawn/IPC/switch/cancel). ONE deferred GPU run: real zimage/qwen children → confirm kill reclaims VRAM + zimage↔qwen no longer OOMs. Not daemon-default until then. | `../serenityUI/PHASE5_PROCESS_ISOLATION_DESIGN.md` |
| 3 | **Z-Image / L2P training** (in-Mojo prepare path) | Pending, AFTER LTX2. 51 alina samples staged at `output/alina_zimage_stage`; need prepare→cache→1-step train gate. | `TRAINING_PLAN_zimage.md` |
| 4 | **serenity-trainer parity campaign** (model-by-model) | Per doc: Chroma/Ernie/Anima/SDXL-stage1 DONE; Qwen/Klein/SDXL-stage2 remain. (Serenity ref deleted — serenitymojo torch parity gates are the oracle.) | `../serenity-trainer/docs/TRAINING_PARITY_CAMPAIGN.md` |
| 5 | **NAVA audio-video** (baidu MMDiT → pure Mojo) | Per doc: oracle up on fp8; chunked parity build + full sampler next. | `serenitymojo/docs/NAVA_INTAKE_PLAN.md` |
| 6 | **OT-parity campaign → V2 ENGINE SWAP (IN PROGRESS — mandate executing)** | 06-11 session 3 (overnight): **Phases A (sync-elim) + C (resident-set) SHIPPED on Z-Image, BIT-EXACT** — B1 2.0-2.1→1.8 s/step, B2 3.5→3.4 s/step = **1.70 s/sample** vs OT 1.05; all gates green (anchors every digit, b1match/b2dup byte-identical, distinct-mean 7 digits). Diagnosis measured: GPU idle 0.56-0.60 s/step from ~1.9k syncs (modvec uploads + per-step lora set rebuild + AdamW 490 MB round trip). Z-Image is now ~kernel-bound (SDPA math-mode). Klein resident-set ALSO SHIPPED: 2.6-2.7→**2.5-2.6 s/step** (optim 0.18→0.081), variance-class gate PASS (Klein's pre-existing ~4e-4 run nondeterminism measured on old binary too; ⚠ klein torch gates still BROKEN at HEAD — anchor-gate only). **THE GRAPH ENGINE ITSELF ALSO SHIPPED same night (P1-P3 + D.1/D.3 + P5 smoke, commits 3243349/dc1de6d/2fc7c6c): serenitymojo/autograd_v2/ dependency-counted engine; zimage B1 backward runs THROUGH the engine (`ZIMAGE_V2_GRAPH`), 100-step BYTE-IDENTICAL to the hand-chain at 1.8 s/step; CUDA-graph capture through MAX MEASURED FEASIBLE (3.6× submit reduction).** Contract: `serenitymojo/docs/AUTOGRAD_V2_MOJO_DESIGN.md` (C1-C15). **P4+P5 ALSO SHIPPED pre-dawn (a6724cb, cad34a7): StepSlab deterministic allocation + CUDA-graph capture/replay — zimage B1 trains via 2 cuGraphLaunch calls (5,774+21,036 nodes), 100-step BYTE-IDENTICAL, 2.0→~1.63 s/step. ENGINE COMPLETE ON ZIMAGE B1.** **P6 Klein graph ALSO SHIPPED (06-11 mid-day session 4, gates run after the overnight session died at disk-full): per-block graphs through the engine (`KLEIN_V2_GRAPH`), same-process bit gate ALL PASS (autograd_v2/tests/klein_block_parity — every grad n_mismatch=0), trainer 3-step anchors inside the variance class, save-state cadence exercised, 2.5-2.6 → 2.2-2.4 s/step.** **SDPA FLASH OP SHIPPED (06-11 session 4, sign-off GRANTED): cuDNN v9 fwd+bwd 35-43x over math-mode, all parity gates PASS (ops/tests/sdpa_flash_parity.mojo); trainer wiring + re-anchor next. P7 groundwork shipped GATED-OFF — measured 24 GB wall (b2 hand-chain peaks 23.4/24; eager ring allocator double-reserves); unblocks after flash wiring + slab-routed B2 fwd.** **KLEIN FLASH WIRED (06-11 evening): 2.2-2.4 → 1.8 s/step (~1.21x to OT), klein_block_parity ALL PASS (dQ-nondeterminism tolerance gates), 4dp anchors unchanged.** **ZIMAGE FLASH WIRED (06-11 night): step ~1.35 s (~1.29x to OT), 4dp anchors hold, capture off (flash>capture).** **IDEOGRAM4 TRAINING FIXED (06-11): old run was a parity-fixture cache + fixed t=0.7 (loss 1.3e-4, grad 0 — learned NOTHING, measured); now real 70-sample giger cache (Mojo VAE+Qwen3-VL prepare, serenity-trainer cad6237) + per-step t~logit-normal(0,1.5) per DiffSynth — 30-step gate: loss 0.6-1.2 class, smooth 1.125→1.059 DECREASING, all 204 LoRA-B nonzero (Σ|B|=65k), 5.4 s/step.** All 8 UI runner binaries rebuilt from HEAD with flash+rpath; UI cache defaults audited (klein+l2p were dangling — fixed). **HIDREAM-O1 VERTICAL SHIPPED (06-11 late): block torch-gated, trainer ~1.0 s/step (98→1.0 measured fix: bf16-resident vs per-visit F32 re-convert), 30-step B-growth gate green.** NEXT: hidream UI target + sampler verdict → inference speed sweep (#6) → P7 B2 → capture-compat flash → ernie/sdxl/l2p fixes. | **`serenitymojo/docs/MOJO_V2_ENGINE_PLAN.md`** (phase ledger, AUTHORITATIVE) + `BEAT_FLAME_SCOREBOARD_2026-06-10.md` 06-11 session-3 entry + `HANDOFF_2026-06-11_OVERNIGHT_OT_PARITY.md` (mandate + verify-commands) |

## How to keep this the ONE list
1. New open work → add a row to **Active** with a link to its detail doc (create the
   detail doc if needed; don't dump depth here).
2. Finish something → move it to **Recently Done** (trim older entries periodically).
3. Writing a new HANDOFF/STATUS for a session? Fine — but add/refresh its **Active**
   row here so this stays the entry point. A handoff nobody can find = a lost handoff.
